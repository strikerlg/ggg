## 5.1.0 (2019-06-28)

Check the `5.1.0-rc1` and `5.1.0-rc2` Changelog for complete list of changes.

#### Enhancements

* Only log when non-existing field is referenced in expressions (breaking change)
* Properly handle expression errors
* Prevent calling arbitrary methods with action (breaking change)
* Add app startup/shutdown events

#### Bugs

* Fix value assignment in EL expression
* Fix duplicate results in number of attachments

#### Breaking Changes

* Calling arbitrary methods from action-method or with `call:` is not allowed.

  All such methods should be annotated with `@CallMethod` annotation (`com.axelor.meta.CallMethod`).
  Use following shell command to find all the method calls in your code base:

  ```
  $ grep -P "(expr)(\s*=\s*)(\"call:([^\"]+\([^\"]+)\")" -r * -oh --include="*.xml" \
    | cut -d\" -f2 \
    | sed -E 's|call:\s*||g' | cut -d\( -f1 | sort -u
  ```

* Scripting expressions in xml actions are now not silent on errors.

  All errors during expression evaluation except missing attribute error are propagated to the user
  so evaluation of such expressions will fail and ultimately actions too.

* DMS permissions (requires manual intervention)

  DMS permissions are created and removed recursively for all children documents/folders.
  The `perm.dms.file.__parent__` permission is no longer used. Also, DMS permissions are readonly
  once created, but can be removed.

  Remove DMS file related permissions (permissions with a name starting with `perm.dms.file`).
  Those permissions will be recreated and updated after adding new DMS permissions.
  Remove and add back DMS permissions on your documents from the DMS view.

* The `context.appLogo` method should now use helper `MetaFiles#getDownloadLink` instead of
  returning `MetaFile`.

* On ManyToOne fields, `canEdit` attribute is `false` by default now.

* The `freeSearch="name"` to search on name field should be changed to `freeSearch="actualNameField"`

* The `cachable` attribute on `entity` definition is now deprecated and replaced with `cacheable`.

  ```
  $ find -iregex ".*domains.*.xml" | xargs -l sed -i 's|cachable="|cacheable="|g'
  ```
